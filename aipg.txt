FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
1) When was mainnet launch? Were there any pre-mined coins or initial coin offering?
AIPG was launched on December 10, 2023. There were no pre-mined coins, no initial coin offering (ICO), no private, public or seed round fundings.

2) What are the tokenomics?
Symbol: AIPG
Block Time: Approximately 1 minute
Block Reward: 500 AIPG per block
Halvening: Every 100,000 blocks
Maximum Supply: 200 million AIPG

The AIPG project introduces a finite maximum supply of 200 million AIPG coins to ensure scarcity and value preservation. By starting with a block reward of 500 AIPG coins, miners are incentivized to secure the network in the early stages of the project. A new halvening schedule was voted on by the community which results in the first halveninig to occur at 100K blocks where the block reward is cut in half. This halvening process, occurring every 100,000 blocks for the first four halvenings, leads to a progressive reduction in the rate at which new coins are created, extending until the emission effectively approaches zero. The maximum supply is designed to be reached over a period that spans multiple decades, allowing for gradual growth and adoption of the AIPG platform, while avoiding inflationary pressures.

3) What are the current emissions and future emissions schedule?
The current emissions is approximately 720k coins a day. After the first halvening, which is currently on track to be around February 2024, emissions will be reduced to 360k coins a day.

**Abstract**
AI Power Grid (AIPG) stands at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence, aiming to make open-source AI technology more accessible and more rewarding for the community. Beginning as a Ravencoin fork, AIPG initially adopts a Proof of Work (PoW) model to attract GPU miners and then later transitions to a Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) framework, which will allow these miners to evolve into node operators that will host and manage local AI workloads.
AI Power Grid aims to provide real-world AI services, such as local LLM inference and Stable Diffusion image generation, at absolutely no cost for community use. There will also be a paid version that provides users with a higher tier secured and trusted node along with API access for integrations.
AIPG is designed to fuel innovation in open-source AI, offering a platform for enthusiasts to experiment, build, and contribute, thereby democratizing AI technology and helping pioneer the next era of open-source AI advancements.

**Background**
AIPG originated from a grassroots movement with a clear vision: to democratize access to artificial intelligence (AI) and galvanize open-source AI initiatives. We firmly believe in the democratization of AI, ensuring its vast potential is not restricted to a select few but made accessible to everyone.
AIPG was developed as a fork of the Ravencoin, chosen for its PoW model and ASIC resistance. This decision was made primarily to recruit GPU miners and help them transition to the Proof of Useful Work model. During this phase, development will continue towards nodes and hosting AI workloads.
AIPG envisions expanding its capacity to accommodate diverse AI workloads in the future and even communication between AI workloads, such as using image generation tools from an LLM, or creating a Mixture of Experts system that is capable of complex tasks. The journey of AIPG is a testament to a dedicated team of developers who are driven by a mission to pave the way for a balanced and sustainable AI ecosystem.

**The AI Power Grid Protocol**
The AI Power Grid protocol is an innovative system designed to democratize open-source AI. AIPG is built on the principles of fairness, transparency, and decentralization, with an initial foundation on the ASIC-resistant KawPoW algorithm during the PoW period. This choice ensures a fair launch and encourages widespread participation from GPU miners, laying the groundwork for a future where AI is accessible to all.
A significant evolution in the protocol is the transition to the PoUW system. In this setup, miners' computational resources are devoted to tangible tasks, predominantly hosting local Large Language Models (LLM) and other predominant AI workloads like Stable Diffusion XL. With expansion to other AI workloads as the network matures.
Integral to the PoUW system is the role of "validator" nodes. These specialized nodes employ a consensus algorithm to authenticate the accuracy and integrity of LLM inference and other tasks conducted by nodes. Utilizing cryptographic verification and cross-referencing, the validators mitigate the risk of data manipulation and ensure honest reporting of computational contributions.
To strengthen the trustworthiness and commitment of these validators, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism is in place. Validator nodes are required to hold a minimum of 1,000 AIPG coins, ensuring their vested interest in the network's success and integrity.

**The AI Power Grid Economic Model**
AIPG introduces a sustainable and balanced economic model. Initially, the protocol capitalizes on a PoW mechanism, granting miners a block reward of 500 AIPG coins for every block. With a block time set at 1 minute, it ensures the efficient and timely processing of transactions.
As AIPG evolves, transitioning to the PoUW system and the associated PoS mechanisms, there will be a phased reduction in block rewards to encourage early adoption and active participation. This gradual decline will continue until the total coin supply nears its 1 billion coin cap.
To champion the ongoing development, innovation, and maintenance of the network, a 5% reward from every mined block will be reserved for the operations wallet. These funds are pivotal in driving the continuous growth and evolution of the AI Power Grid ecosystem. AIPG's economic model is structured to ensure fairness and inclusivity. It emphasizes rewarding early adopters while laying the foundation for sustainable growth.

**Transition to Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)**
AIPG's planned progression from the conventional PoW to our innovative PoUW represents a reimagining of computational value. In the PoUW model, the focus isn't just on expanding the blockchain, but on endorsing and incentivizing truly productive computational endeavors.
With this transition, node operators within the AIPG network will take on the role of hosting individual local LLMs and other local AI workloads. By doing so, AIPG not only democratizes access to these powerful AI tools but also actively offers rewards for hosting and running inference tasks on these models.
As the AIPG ecosystem evolves, our vision encompasses the potential to support a broader range of AI workloads beyond just LLMs and AI Art. For miners, this shift to PoUW might necessitate some adjustments to their existing setups, ensuring they're equipped to optimally host and run LLMs and other potential AI workloads. This alignment with PoUW is essential to ensure nodes can handle high PCIe bandwidth AI tasks, reinforcing the network's growth, security, and overarching mission.
By intertwining the domains of blockchain and AI, AIPG endeavors to stimulate a more inclusive and expansive movement in AI and machine learning. We're not just nurturing a network; we're curating a community poised to drive the next wave of AI advancements.

**Future Plans and Roadmap**
