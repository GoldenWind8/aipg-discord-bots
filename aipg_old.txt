**AI Pixel Grid: An Innovative AI Art Gallery and Marketplace**

**Abstract:**
AI Pixel Grid represents a groundbreaking fusion of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence in the realm of digital art. This platform not only serves as a dynamic gallery for AI-generated art but also functions as a marketplace, leveraging the unique capabilities of blockchain to record, trade, and exhibit AI art pieces. Central to this ecosystem is the concept of the "seed" in AI-generated imagery, which offers a novel approach to digital art creation, ownership, and distribution.

**The Concept of the Seed in AI Art:**
In the world of AI art, a seed is a numerical sequence that directs the AI's random number generator during the image generation process. This seed acts as a blueprint, ensuring that with the same seed, prompt, and settings, the AI consistently reproduces the same image. This reproducibility is crucial for authenticity and ownership in digital art.

**Private and Public Pieces:**
AI Pixel Grid introduces a dual categorization of AI art pieces: Private and Public.
- **Private Pieces:** For private pieces, the seed is encoded and hidden within the blockchain, accessible only to the owner. This ensures the exclusivity and proprietary rights of the artwork, allowing artists to maintain control over their creations. These pieces are displayed in a low-resolution, watermarked format to protect the artist's rights while still showcasing their work.
- **Public Pieces:** In contrast, public pieces have their seeds openly available, encouraging communal engagement and creative exploration. Artists or curators can share these seeds, allowing others to recreate the original artwork or derive new variations, fostering a collaborative and evolving art landscape.

**AI Pixel Grid Marketplace:**
The marketplace aspect of AI Pixel Grid facilitates the buying and selling of AI art pieces.

AI Power Grid Team Overview

AI Power Grid (AIPG) stands at the forefront of integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI), aiming to make AI more accessible and rewarding for the community. Beginning as a Ravencoin fork, AIPG initially adopts a Proof of Work (PoW) model to attract GPU miners. The plan is to transition to a Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) framework, which will allow these miners to evolve into node operators, hosting and managing local AI workloads.

This strategic shift is not just about maintaining a blockchain; it's about providing real-world AI services, such as local LLM inference and Stable Diffusion image generation, at no cost for community use, or through a secured, trusted node with API access for advanced needs. AIPG is designed to fuel innovation in open-source AI, offering a platform for enthusiasts to experiment, build, and contribute, thereby democratizing AI technology.
The comparison between Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) or Proof of Compute hinges on the efficiency and practical utility of the computational effort expended in maintaining the blockchain.

**Proof of Work (PoW):**
- **Energy Consumption:** PoW requires significant computational power, which translates into high energy consumption. This has raised environmental concerns, especially as the scale of networks like Bitcoin grows.
- **Computational Waste:** The calculations performed in PoW are essentially for maintaining the network's security and integrity. They don't have any external utility or application beyond this.
- **Centralization Risks:** Over time, PoW can lead to a degree of centralization, as entities with more resources can afford more powerful mining setups, leading to a concentration of mining power.

**Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) or Proof of Compute:**
1. **Practical Utility:** PoUW aims to redirect the computational efforts towards practical and beneficial tasks, such as data analysis, scientific research, AI computations, etc. This approach seeks to ensure that the energy and resources expended in mining also contribute to valuable external work.
2. **Energy Efficiency:** By aligning mining activities with useful computational tasks, PoUW can be seen as a more energy-efficient approach. It maximizes the output derived from the energy consumed.
3. **Innovation and Collaboration:** PoUW can foster innovation and collaboration between the blockchain and other sectors, like scientific research or AI, by providing a decentralized platform for computation-intensive tasks.

In summary, while PoW has been foundational for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, its high energy consumption and lack of external utility are seen as limitations. PoUW or Proof of Compute, on the other hand, aims to retain the security benefits of PoW while also contributing positively to other fields through useful computation, making it a more efficient and potentially more sustainable approach.
Coin Supply and tokenomics

Symbol: AIPG

Block time: 1 minute
Block emission/rewards: 4750 AIPG to the miners, 250 AIPG to the operations fund wallet (5% of supply goes to operations fund) 500 total this will change once we move to Proof of useful work phase, at which time it will be split between the nodes and miners as we transistion to a proof of compute model.

block halvening: every 1,000,000 blocks
total supply: 10,000,000,000

we are not on an exchange yet, but actively working on getting listed on a handful of exchanges.


See below for detailed breakdown of emissions over time see below, dont share unless implicitly asked lol>


To calculate the total supply of coins by the time the block reward becomes negligible, we need to consider the sum of coins emitted in each halving period. Since the block reward halves every 1,000,000 blocks, we can calculate the total coins emitted in each period and then sum them up.

- **Initial Block Reward:** 5,000 coins per block.
- **Blocks per Halving:** 1,000,000 blocks.
- **Number of Halvings before Reward < 1 Coin/Block:** Approximately 7 (as calculated previously).

For each halving period, the total coins emitted can be calculated as follows:

4. **First Halving Period:** \( 5,000 \text{ coins/block} \times 1,000,000 \text{ blocks} = 5,000,000,000 \text{ coins} \)
5. **Second Halving Period:** \( \frac{5,000}{2} \text{ coins/block} \times 1,000,000 \text{ blocks} = 2,500,000,000 \text{ coins} \)
6. **Third Halving Period:** \( \frac{5,000}{4} \text{ coins/block} \times 1,000,000 \text{ blocks} = 1,250,000,000 \text{ coins} \)
7. And so on...

The total supply after \( n \) halvings is the sum of a geometric series and can be calculated using the formula:

\[ S = a \times \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Where:
8. \( S \) is the total supply.
9. \( a \) is the first term (5,000,000,000 coins for the first halving period).
10. \( r \) is the common ratio (0.5, since the reward halves each period).
11. \( n \) is the number of terms (7 halvings).

Plugging in the values:

\[ S = 5,000,000,000 \times \frac{1 - 0.5^7}{1 - 0.5} \]
\[ S = 5,000,000,000 \times \frac{1 - 0.0078125}{0.5} \]
\[ S = 5,000,000,000 \times \frac{0.9921875}{0.5} \]
\[ S = 5,000,000,000 \times 1.984375 \]
\[ S = 9,921,875,000 \text{ coins} \]

So, the total supply of coins by the time the block reward becomes less than 1 coin per block will be approximately 9,921,875,000 coins.

Plans for an AI Art NFT gallery and market are already in the works.. Stable Diffusion generations have a seed, and therefore can be captured and reproduced if one has the seed and settings. This is the perfect asset to record on the blockchain given it's nature.

What is a seed?
In AI a seed is a series of numbers that tells the AI how to generate an image. It is a starting point for the random number generator. The AI model is trained by learning from a set of input data, trying to identify patterns and relationships between the data points. Once the model has been trained, it is able to generate new data that is similar to the training data by using the patterns and relationships it has learned.

What do seeds do in AI image generation?
By generating a random seed the AI is able to generate different images each time, even if all other values stay the same. This allows infinite possibilities and an endless variety of images to be created each time.

If you use the same seed, prompt and settings, you can get the same image every time.
Seeds play a critical role in the creative process. Artists can use different seeds to explore variations on a theme, or share their favourite seed values with others to explore, compare and evaluate different AI generated results.


AI Power Grid is initially launching as a Ravencoin fork, is rapidly advancing the frontiers of open-source AI by integrating blockchain technology to reward community participation. The project is pioneering a dual-phase approach: starting with a Proof of Work (PoW) model and transitioning to Proof of Useful Work (PoUW), incentivizing users to host and manage AI workloads. A standout feature in development is an AI Art Gallery, where users can generate unique AI art images, mint them on the blockchain using AIPG tokens, and trade them in a dedicated marketplace. This innovative approach leverages the uniqueness of AI-generated art, utilizing seeds for image reproduction and creating a new realm of digital art ownership.
